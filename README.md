# Rubiks-Cube-2018

This is a graphical Rubik's cube I've created in 2018. 
The working version is in: Rubik's Cube/src/RubiksCubeWorking/

To run the program run Main. (The auto solver feature is undone ):)
The Rubik's Cube/src/RubiksCube2/ version is a differents implementaion that uses more sophisticated algorithem to represent and show a nxn Rubik's cube. This version's code is basicly completed but it has a few bugs I haven't resolved.
